# TFTRIS

I wanted to make combinatris + bomberman with a decided transformation theme.

Right now it's just a faithful reimplementation of combinatris. (No scoring though.) I have added a lot of
TF but it doesn't really play like anything yet.

I'm using the GPL for now because I can't think of a legitimate reason anyone would need to redistribute this. (Note that the placeholder icons are borrowed from World of Warcraft and cannot _possibly_ be used commercially; only the code itself is protected.) 

If you want different licensing terms, ask me!
